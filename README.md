# torjail
bind a program inside a network namespace that could exit only with tor

### requirements
you'll need a running tor instance with following configuration:
```
VirtualAddrNetwork 10.200.1.1/10
AutomapHostsSuffixes .onion,.exit
AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 9040
TransListenAddress 10.200.1.1
DNSPort 5353
DNSListenAddress 10.200.1.1
```

### usage examples:

- the help menu:
`torjail -h`

- get an homepage content via tor, executing curl as user $USER
`sudo torjail -u $USER curl autistici.org > autistici.org `

- resolve a onion address:
`sudo torjail dig wi7qkxyrdpu5cmvr.onion`

- get an onion webserver content via tor:
`sudo torjail curl wi7qkxyrdpu5cmvr.onion`

- open a firefox with user $USER that could only reach internet via tor:
`./torjail -u $USER firefox -P /tmp/tmpprofile`

> warning: firefox has a flag that block .onion resolution by default -> change it using about:config network.dns.blockDotOnion

- get a shell that could not reach internet (only via tor)
`./torjail -s -u $USER`

- custom network configuration:
`./torjail -r 10.10.1.1 10.10.1.2 24 ls`

- create a namespace called $NS in verbose mode:
`./torjail -n $NS -v ls`

- keep the existing /etc/resolv.conf after the execution:
`./torjail -k ls`

> in order to support the correct routing, /etc/resolv.conf is mounted to a temporary file inside the namespace, generated by torjail.
